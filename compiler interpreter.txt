DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMPILER AND INTERPRETER:

COMPILER  :
           Compiler is a translater that translate higher level languague(source program) to assembly level language(target program)
           Higher level language:This is consider to be high level because they are close to human languages.
           Assembly level language:it is a low level language which designed to operate entire hardware and instruction set.These are closer to                 computers.
           Compiler refers to a program which transtales  source code into the java virtual machine bytecodes.
           Compiler checks the source code and point out all bugs,and run a program
           EG:c++,java,c
              
INTERPRETER:
           Interpreter is responsible to run program line by line.
           It directly executes that is perform instructions written in a programming language without previously compiling them into machine                   language programm.
           Comparing to compiler interpreter detects bugs line by line  more efficitely.
           JVM is interpreter which is responsible to read lines and execute programme line by line.
           EG:BASIC,PYTHON etc
